## Usage
Wait until the scene loads. If your internet connection is slow, it might take times to download the models the first time, after that they will be in cache and loading will be faster.  
Whenever the loading is complete, you can click with the mouse to a point in the room to reach it or you can use the button in the right upper part of the browser's window to perform an action (dab dance, hello movement, affermative movement).  
Use the button in the left upper part of the browser's window to change room or return back to the main menu.
